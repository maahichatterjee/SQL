# Insert Default Values

**🔗 [View on NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/problems/sql-insert-default-values/question)**

---

When inserting rows into a table, we can omit columns:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
);

INSERT INTO users (id)
  VALUES (1), (2), (3);
```

In the above example, we inserted 3 rows into the `users` table, but we only specified the `id` column. The `name` column was omitted. The resulting table is:

id
name

1
NULL

2
NULL

3
NULL

The `name` column was omitted, so the default value for `name` is `NULL`. Since the `id` column is a `PRIMARY KEY`, it is not allowed to be `NULL` and thus can't be omitted.

Recall that if a table column is given a `DEFAULT` value, then that column can be omitted when inserting rows.

#### Challenge

You are given a table `products` with the following columns:

- `id` of type `INTEGER` as the primary key

- `name` of type `TEXT`

- `stock` of type `INTEGER` with a `DEFAULT` value of `0`

Insert the following rows into the table in the order given:

id
name
stock

1
'Apple'
0

2
'Banana'
0

3
'Orange'
0

You can explicitly set the `stock` column to `0` but it is more simple in this case to omit it since it has a `DEFAULT` value of `0`.
