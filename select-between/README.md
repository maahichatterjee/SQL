# Select Between

**🔗 [View on NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/problems/sql-select-between/question)**

---

We can use the `BETWEEN` keyword to filter rows based on a range of values.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM comments
WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND 3;
```

This will return all rows from the `comments` table where the `id` column is between 1 and 3 inclusive, or `1 <= id <= 3`. We use `BETWEEN` to filter for a range of values and we use the `AND` operator to specify both a lower and upper bound.

We can do the same for strings and other data types.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM comments
WHERE author BETWEEN 'Eat' AND 'Neet';
```

This will return all rows from the `comments` table where the `author` column is between 'Eat' and 'Neet' inclusive, or `'Eat' <= author <= 'Neet'`.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM comments
WHERE posted_at BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31';
```

This will return all rows from the `comments` table where the `posted_at` is between '2024-01-01' and '2024-01-31' inclusive. You can assume the `posted_at` column is a `DATE` data type.

#### Challenge

You are given a table called `cities`. Return all unique countries from the `country` column that have a population between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000 inclusive.
