# Auto Increment

It's often necessary to assign a unique identifier to each row in a table. Rather than manually assigning a unique value to each row, PostgreSQL provides a way to automatically generate one for each row by auto incrementing.

There are a few different ways to do this in PostgreSQL:

1. `SERIAL`: This is a shorthand for creating an auto-incrementing integer column.

2. `IDENTITY`: Introduced in PostgreSQL 10, this is the SQL standard way to create auto-incrementing columns.

3. `SEQUENCES`: You can define your own sequence, and set the start value and increment value.

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE example_id_seq START WITH 10 INCREMENT BY 10;

CREATE TABLE example (
    id_0 INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    id_1 SERIAL,
    id_2 INTEGER GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    id_3 INTEGER DEFAULT nextval('example_id_seq')
);

INSERT INTO example (id_0)
  VALUES (1),
        (2),
        (3);

SELECT * FROM example;
```

Notice that we only inserted values into the `id_0` column. The other columns were automatically populated similar to `DEFAULT` values.

The following are the results of the above query:

id_0
id_1
id_2
id_3

1
1
1
10

2
2
2
20

3
3
3
30

1. `SERIAL` is the most common method for creating auto-incrementing columns in PostgreSQL but may not be supported in other SQL databases.

2. `IDENTITY` is the SQL standard way to create auto-incrementing columns. `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` means that the column is automatically generated based on the sequence and does not allow explicit insertion, unlike `SERIAL`.

3. A `SEQUENCE` can be shared by multiple tables, which means that both tables will have a unique sequence of integers. For example, `table-a` may have `10, 30, 50` and `table-b` may have `20, 40, 60`. They won't have any overlap.

#### Challenge

Create a sequence called `gov_id` that starts at `1000` and increments by `3`.

Create a table called `gov_employee` with the following columns:

- `id` of type `INTEGER` that uses the `IDENTITY` keyword to auto increment, and does not allow explicit insertion. It should also be the primary key of the table.

- `gov_id` of type `INTEGER` where the `DEFAULT` value is the next value from the `gov_id` sequence.

- `name` of type `TEXT`.
