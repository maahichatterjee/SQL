# Select Like

PostgreSQL provides the `LIKE` operator to filter strings based on patterns rather than exact string matching.

The `LIKE` operator uses the following wildcard characters:

- `%`: Matches any sequence of characters.

- `_`: Matches any single character.

For example, if we want to return all rows from the `comments` table where the `author` column starts with an `N`, we can use the following query:

```text
SELECT *
FROM comments
WHERE author LIKE 'N%';
```

This will return all rows where the `author` column starts with `N`, where the `%` wildcard matches any sequence of characters. The comparison is case-sensitive, so it will only return rows where the `author` column starts with `N` and not an `n`.

If we want to return all rows where the `author` column starts with an `N` and has at least 3 characters, we can use the following query:

```text
SELECT *
FROM comments
WHERE author LIKE 'N__%';
```

The `N__%` has three components:

1. `N`: The first character must be `N`.

2. `__%`: The second and third characters can be any characters.

3. `%'`: The rest of the string can be any characters, or nothing at all.

#### Challenge

You are given a table called `cities`. Return the *name* of all cities where the `name` column contains the substring `ai`.

Hint: You can use the `%` wildcard multiple times in your pattern.
