# Select Logical Operators

**🔗 [View on NeetCode](https://neetcode.io/problems/sql-select-logical-operators/question)**

---

We can combine multiple conditions using the `AND` and `OR` logical operators.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM cities
WHERE population >= 1000000 AND population <= 10000000;
```

The above query will return all distinct countries from the `cities` table where the `population` is between `1,000,000` and `10,000,000` inclusive.

We can also use parentheses to group multiple conditions.

```sql
SELECT name
FROM cities
WHERE (country = 'USA' OR country = 'Canada') AND population >= 1000000;
```

The above query will return all names from the `cities` table where the `country` is either `USA` or `Canada` and the `population` is greater than or equal to `1,000,000`.

#### Challenge

You are given a table called `cities`. Return all names from the `cities` table where the `population` is less than `1,000,000` or greater than `10,000,000`, and the name of the city does not start with an uppercase `C`.
